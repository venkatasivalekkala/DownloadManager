#Dowanload Manager
Build the fake download manager illustrated in the attached mockup. Note that you only need to build a working UI for this page. You do not need to provide actual downloading functionality, merely simulate it by way of the progress bars.
Use this sprite for the graphics: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8q5w3qupa6347d4/icon-sprite.png?dl=1&pv=1
Please, use this codepen (http://codepen.io/supermisha/pen/Megvjb), and complete the exercise in it. Save it and let me know when you're done.
DESIRED BEHAVIOR: Users should be able to add files to (and remove files from) the list dynamically. Users should be able to search for the files regardless of whether or not they were "downloaded." When the "Download All" button is clicked, files are "downloaded" one by one in sequential order. In other words, once the first progress bar becomes full, the second progress bar starts filling up; when the second progress bar becomes full, the third one starts filling up, and so on.
You may use any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript preprocessors that you like. You may not use any external libraries (such as jQuery).
